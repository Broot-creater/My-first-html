<ol type="1">
  <li>A ratio is formed when two quantities are compared by division that is, a/b or a:b.</li>
  <li>A ratio is written in its simplest form and has no unit.</li>
  <li>If a quantity, increases (or decreases) in the ratio a:b, then the new quantity is b/a of the original quantity, b/a is called the multiplying factor.</li>
  <li>If we have to divide a given number A in the ratio a:b:c ,then,
<br> First part = a / a+b+c    x   A 
<br>Second part =  b/a+b+c       x   A
<br>  Third part = c/a+b+c     x  A </li>
	<li>An equality of two ratios is called a proportion.The first and fourth terms are called extremes and second and third terms are called means.</li>
	<li>Four quantities a,b,c and d are said to be in proportion if a/b =c/d.</li>
	<li>In a proportion a:b :: c:d,d is said to be fourth proportion.In a proportion a:b :: c:d,d is said to be fourth proportion.</li>
	<li>Three quantities a,b,c are said to be in continued proportion if b2=ac</li>
	<li>In the continued proportion a:b :: b:c,b is called the mean proportional between a and c,and c is called the third proportional.</li>
